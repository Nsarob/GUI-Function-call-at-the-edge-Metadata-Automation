Similarly, members of the university working under contracts signed before the effective date of this policy who do not choose to accept this policy will remain bound by the patent policies that already apply to them. With respect to intellectual property developed during the course of employment at the university, this policy shall continue to be binding on any person whose relationship with the university becomes terminated.

Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11]\\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. 1820\\nNational Republican\\n1832\\nVacant\\xa0afterDecember 28, 1832\\nMartin Van Buren\\nUnaffiliated\\nVacant\\xa0afterApril 18, 1853\\n'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States', 'content': 'The following decade, Woodrow Wilson led the nation to victory during World War I, although Wilson\\'s proposal for the League of Nations was rejected by the Senate.[42]\\nWarren Harding, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially Teapot Dome,[43] and Herbert Hoover quickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the Great Depression.[44]\\nImperial presidency\\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the Imperial presidency.[45] Backed by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt\\'s New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies.[46]:\\u200a211–12\\u200a The traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the President being created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation.[46]:\\u200a229–231\\u200a Roosevelt\\'s unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation\\'s growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership.[46]:\\u200a269\\u200a His successors, Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, each served two terms as the Cold War led the presidency to be viewed as the \"leader of the free world\",[47] while John F. Kennedy was a youthful and popular leader who benefited from the rise of television in the 1960s.[48][49]\\nAfter Lyndon B. Johnson lost popular support due to the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon\\'s presidency collapsed in the Watergate scandal, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.[50][51] However, his successor, Martin Van Buren, became unpopular after the Panic of 1837,[31] and the death of William Henry Harrison and subsequent poor relations between John Tyler and Congress led to further weakening of the office.[32] Including Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.[33] The Senate played an important role during this period, with the Great Triumvirate of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun playing key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.[34][35]\\nAbraham Lincoln\\'s leadership during the Civil War has led historians to regard him as one of the nation\\'s greatest presidents.[D] The circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,[36][37] and Lincoln\\'s re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. Recent presidents have thus increasingly focused on executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.[60] Presidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush and Donald Trump, winning in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.[E]\\nCritics of presidency\\'s evolution\\nThe nation\\'s Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government; however, they did not expect a strong executive department.[61] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,[62][63] unchecked, unbalanced,[64] and \"monarchist\" in nature.[65] The mechanism has been used by Ronald Reagan (once), George W. Bush (twice), and Joe Biden (once), each in anticipation of surgery.[155][156]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.[86] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president\\'s powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No. 69:\\nThe President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.\\xa0...'}, {'url': 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/', 'content': 'Presidents | The White House The 4th President of the United States The 5th President of the United States The 6th President of the United States The 7th President of the United States The 8th President of the United States The 9th President of the United States The 10th President of the United States The 11th President of the United States The 12th President of the United States The 13th President of the United States The 14th President of the United States The 15th President of the United States The 16th President of the United States The 17th President of the United States The 18th President of the United States Biden\\xa0Jr. THE 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES'}, {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden', 'content': 'On November 23, after Michigan certified its results, Murphy issued the letter of ascertainment, granting the Biden transition team access to federal funds and resources for an orderly transition.[29]\\nTwo days after becoming the projected winner of the 2020 election, Biden announced the formation of a task force to advise him on the COVID-19 pandemic during the transition, co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former FDA commissioner David A. Kessler, and Yale University\\'s Marcella Nunez-Smith.[30]\\nOn January 5, 2021, the Democratic Party won control of the United States Senate, effective January 20, as a result of electoral victories in Georgia by Jon Ossoff in a runoff election for a six-year term and Raphael Warnock in a special runoff election for a two-year term.[31][32] President-elect Biden had supported and campaigned for both candidates prior to the runoff elections on January 5.[33][34]\\nOn January 6, a mob of thousands of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol in the hope of overturning Biden\\'s election, forcing Congress to evacuate during the counting of the Electoral College votes.[35][36] More than 26,000 National Guard members were deployed to the capital for the inauguration, with thousands remaining into the spring.[37]\\nOn January 20, 2021, Biden was sworn in by U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts as the 46th president of the United States, completing the oath of office at 11:49\\xa0am EST, eleven minutes before the legal start of his term.[38][39]\\nInaugural address\\nBiden\\'s inaugural speech laid out his vision to unite the nation, prefaced by the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic strife, climate change, political polarization, and racial injustice.[40] The union representing ICE agents signaled that its agents would not accept reversals of Trump policies.[232]\\nIn March 2021, the Biden administration granted temporary protected status to Venezuelans fleeing the country amidst the ongoing political and economic crisis.[234]\\nOn June 1, 2021, the\\xa0DHS officially terminated the\\xa0Trump-era \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which mandated that all\\xa0asylum seekers\\xa0from\\xa0Central America\\xa0were to wait in\\xa0Mexico\\xa0pending their court cases; however, a health order from March 2020 allowed the border authorities to send migrants back for the duration of the\\xa0COVID-19 pandemic\\xa0have remained in place.[235][236] However, on August 14, 2021, a federal judge in Texas ordered the Biden administration to reimplement the policy; the Supreme Court placed a pause on the ruling to give the administration time for arguments.[237][238] On August 24, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration must comply with the lower court\\'s ruling to reinstate the policy.[239][240]\\nEarly on in Biden\\'s tenure, a surge in unaccompanied minors at the U.S. border stirred controversy. The administration also expanded ties with West Africa, including support for infrastructure improvements at the Benin seaport of Cotonou, a key part of the West African economy.[372][376] Biden appointed longtime U.S. diplomat Johnnie Carson to coordinate implementation of U.S. actions following up from the summit.[377]\\nDuring the 2022 summit, Biden and senior administration officials also met privately with six African leaders facing elections in 2023, pushing them to ensure free and fair elections in their nations.[377]\\nSenator Bob Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has criticized the Biden administration for hesitating to impose sanctions on the governments of Sudan and Ethiopia, where many atrocities and war crimes were committed in the Tigray War.[378]\\nArmenian genocide\\nOn April 24, 2021, the Biden administration declared that the Turkish killings of Armenians at the start of the 20th century were a genocide. Others criticize the CDC for implementing this change following lobbying by Delta Airlines, leading to social media backlash against the federal government.[117]\\nBiden gave a speech at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on September 12, 2022, the 60th anniversary of Kennedy\\'s We Choose to Go to the Moon speech, promoting his administration\\'s revival of the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot, including the new Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.[118]\\nEconomy\\nOn January 22, 2021, Biden signed an executive order that removed schedule F, overturning a number of Trump\\'s policies that limited the collective bargaining power of federal unions.[119][120][121] Biden\\'s executive order also promotes a $15 minimum wage for federal workers and repeals three of Trump\\'s executive orders which made the employee discipline process stricter and restricted union representatives\\' access to office space. Biden partly attributed the lack of early evacuation of Afghan civilians to the Afghan government\\'s opposition of a \"mass exodus\" which they thought would cause a \"crisis of confidence\".[360]\\nOn August 26, a suicide attack was carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - Khorasan Province at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing more than 170 people, including at least 62 Afghan civilians, 13 US service members, two British nationals and the child of a third British national.[361][362] Biden made a public address following the attack, in which he honored the American service members who were killed, calling them \"heroes\" and saying they lost their lives \"in the service of liberty\", and stated that the US had evacuated more than 100,000 Americans, Afghans, and others.'}]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe current and 46th President of the United States is Joseph R.
